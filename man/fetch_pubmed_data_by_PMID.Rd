\title{Retrieve PubMed Data in XML or TXT Format based on a list of PMIDs}
\usage{
fetch_pubmed_data_by_PMID(pmids,
                                 batch = 50,
                                 format = "xml",
                                 encoding = "UTF-8",
                                 verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pmids}{file name or PMID character vector; this can point to a file including a list of PMIDs
(for example, a PMID file downloaded from the PubMed website), or a character vector including
a list of PMIDs (example: c("31867428", "31564976", "31564903")).}

\item{batch}{Integer (>10 and <55): number of PMIDs to be retrieved at each iteration.}

\item{format}{Character: element specifying the output format. The following values are allowed:
c("asn.1", "xml", "medline", "uilist", "abstract"). Note that "uilist" will only retrieve PMIDs.}

\item{encoding}{The encoding of an input/output connection can be specified by name
(for example, "ASCII", or "UTF-8", in the same way as it would be given to the function base::iconv().
See iconv() help page for how to find out more about encodings that can be used on your platform.
Here, we recommend using "UTF-8".}

\item{verbose}{logical, shall info about the progress of the data download be printed/messaged to console.}
}
\value{
An object (vector) of class "character". If format is set to "xml" (default), a single String including all
PubMed records (with XML tags embedded) is returned. If a different format is selected, a vector of strings
is returned, where each row corresponds to a line of the output document.
}
\description{
Retrieve PubMed records from Entrez starting from a list of PumBed IDs (PMIDs).
Data are downloaded in the XML or TXT format and are retrieved in batches of up to 55 PMIDs
at a time.
}
\details{
Retrieve PubMed records based on a list of PMIDs.
Records are retrieved from Entrez via the PubMed API efetch function.
Data will be downloaded on the fly (no files are saved locally).
